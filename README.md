Great! It sounds like you're working with a full-stack project that involves Go for the backend, React with TypeScript for the frontend, and Vite for build tools. Based on this, here's a detailed `README.md` for your project that covers both the Go server setup and the React/TypeScript frontend configuration.

# Full-Stack Currency Exchange App

This project is a full-stack web application that provides currency exchange functionality. It features a backend built with Go and Fiber, a lightweight web framework, and a frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app allows users to interact with real-time currency exchange rates and perform conversions seamlessly.

## Backend (Go)

The backend server is built with [Go](https://golang.org/) and the [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) framework. It provides endpoints for currency exchange functionality, handling requests to fetch live exchange rates and performing conversion operations.

### Setup

1. Install Go if you haven't already: [Go Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Run the Go server:

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

### Configuration

The backend uses environment variables for configuration. You can set up your `.env` file with the necessary values, such as API keys for exchange rates.

```env
# .env
EXCHANGE_API_URL=https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD
PORT=3001
```

## Frontend (React/TypeScript)

The frontend is a React application using TypeScript, built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It communicates with the Go backend to display exchange rates and allow currency conversion.

### Setup

1. Install Node.js (if not installed already): [Node.js Installation](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Run the React app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the React development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/currency-exchange-app.git
cd currency-exchange-app
```

2. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install Go dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your API URL and any required keys.

4. Run the Go server:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Set up the `.env` file in the `frontend` directory, defining the backend server URL (assuming it's running locally):

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

3. Run the frontend app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` by default.

## Usage

- Open the frontend application at `http://localhost:5173/`.
- Enter the amount in one currency, select the source and target currencies, and the app will show the converted amount based on real-time exchange rates.

The frontend communicates with the Go backend API to fetch the latest exchange rates and perform conversions.

## Features

- **Currency Conversion**: Convert between any two currencies.
- **Real-time Exchange Rates**: Fetch live rates from the backend (integrating with an exchange rates API).
- **Responsive Design**: Use the app on any device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React and TypeScript for strong typing and better developer experience.

## Dependencies

### Backend (Go)

- [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/): Web framework for Go
- [GoDotEnv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv): Load environment variables from a `.env` file

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Next-generation, fast build tool
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed superset of JavaScript
